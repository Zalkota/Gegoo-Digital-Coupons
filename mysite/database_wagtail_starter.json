If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, the primary email address on file will be used for this purpose. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current or up to date at all times. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. In dedicated server purchases or high risk transactions, it will be necessary to provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for the purchase. If you fail to meet these requirements, the order may be considered fraudulent in nature and be denied.</p><p>Transfers</p><p>Our transfers team will make every effort to help you move your site to us. However, transfers are provided as a courtesy service, and we can not make guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host.</p><p>We no longer offer a FREE Transfer service with Sign-up.

An employee will confirm your request (and process your cancellation) shortly thereafter. If you do not hear back from us, or do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after submitting your cancellation, please contact us immediately via phone. We require that cancellations of service are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing you are prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process reduces the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and ensures you are aware that the files, emails, and account may be removed immediately after a cancellation request is processed.</p><p>As a client of Mod Technologies, it is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. Mod Technologies provides a 30 day grace period from the time the invoice is due and when it must be paid.

Mod Technologies gives you an unconditional 30 day money back guarantee on managed shared hosting, dedicated server, and reseller solutions for any customer who paid the first invoice with a credit card or with Paypal.</p><p>The following methods of payments are non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as credit to the hosting account:</p><p>* Bank Wire Transfers</p><p>* Western Union Payments</p><p>* Cash</p><p>* Checks</p><p>* Money orders</p><p>There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases. Refund requests for shared and reseller accounts after the initial 30 days will be refunded on a prorated basis of any unused time.</p><p>Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you\\u2019ve had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with us.</p><p>Violations of the Terms of Service or User Agreement will waive the refund policy.</p><p>7a.) Resource Usage</p><p>User may not:</p><p>a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.</p><p>b) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.</p><p>c) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.</p><p>d) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.</p><p>e) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.</p><p>f) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities</p><p>g) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc</p><p>h) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes</p><p>When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of include(\\u201chttp://yourdomain.com/include.php\\u201d) use include(\\u201cinclude.php\\u201d)</p><p>7b.) INODES</p><p>The use of more than 50,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in suspension. Accounts found to be exceeding the 50,000 inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup system to avoid overusage. Every file (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.</p><p>Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that constantly create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension.</p><p>The primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox. Over time, tens of thousands of messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit. To disable your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose \\u201cMail\\u201d, then \\u201cDefault Address\\u201d, \\u201cSet Default Address\\u201d, and then type in: :fail: No such user here</p><p>8.) Bandwidth Usage</p><p>You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.</p><p>9a.) Money back Guarantee</p><p>On dedicated servers and colocation no full refund will be honored \\u2014 the 30 day money back guarantee does not apply. We reserve the right to refund a prorated amount or no refund at all.</p><p>Each of Mod Technologies\\u2019s managed shared and reseller servers carry a 30 day unconditional money back guarantee on them. If you are not completely satisfied with our services within the first 30 days of your service, you will be given a full refund of the contract amount. Remember, this is only for monthly shared or reseller packages and does not apply to dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases.</p><p>9b.) Uptime Guarantee</p><p>If your shared / reseller server has a physical downtime that is not within the 99.9% uptime you may receive one month of credit on your account. Approval of the credit is at the discretion of Mod Technologies dependant upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor\\u2019s network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please contact sales@asdesignsandservices.com with justification. All requests must be made in writing via email. Uptime guarantees only apply to shared / reseller solutions. Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.</p><p>10.) Reseller: Client Responsibility</p><p>Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. Mod Technologies does not provide support to our Reseller\\u2019s Clients. If a reseller\\u2019s client contacts us, we reserve the right to place the client account on hold until the reseller can assume their responsibility for their client. All support requests must be made by the reseller on their clients\\u2019 behalf for security purposes. Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account and the actions of their clients\\u2019. Mod Technologies will hold any reseller responsible for any of their clients actions that violate the law or the terms of service.</p><p>11.) Shared (non-reseller accounts) / Semidedicated Servers</p><p>Shared accounts may not resell web hosting to other people, if you wish to resell hosting you must use a reseller account. Semidedicated servers are not backed up. You must maintain your own backups.</p><p>12.) Dedicated Servers</p><p>Mod Technologies reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for their dedicated server on file to prevent downtime from forced password resets. Mod Technologies reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us and it is the responsibility of the client to maintain backups or have a solution for this. You may purchase an additional hard drive and maintain backups to it as the most simple solution. Please contact sales@asdesignsandservices.com if you wish to obtain a secondary hard drive. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.</p><p>13.) Price Change</p><p>The amount you pay for hosting will never increase from the date of purchase. We reserve the right to change prices listed on our company websites, and the right to increase the amount of resources given to plans at any time.</p><p>14a.) Indemnification</p><p>Customer agrees that it shall defend, indemnify, save and hold Mod Technologies harmless from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims, including reasonable attorney\\u2019s fees asserted against Mod Technologies, its agents, its customers, officers and employees, that may arise or result from any service provided or performed or agreed to be performed or any product sold by customer, its agents, employees or assigns.

Arbitration</p><p>By using any Mod Technologies services, you agree to submit to binding arbitration. If any disputes or claims arise against Mod Technologies or its subsidiaries, such disputes will be handled by an arbitrator of Mod Technologies\\u2019s choice. An arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association or the National Arbitration Forum will be selected in the state of Michigan. Arbitrators shall be attorneys or retired judges and shall be selected pursuant to the applicable rules. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The arbitrator\\u2019s award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. You are also responsible for any and all costs related to such arbitration.</p><p>15.) Disclaimer</p><p>Mod Technologies shall not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. Mod Technologies makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for services we provide. Mod Technologies disclaims any warranty or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

However, transfers are provided as a courtesy service, and we can not make guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host.</p><p>We no longer offer a FREE Transfer service with Sign-up.

An employee will confirm your request (and process your cancellation) shortly thereafter. If you do not hear back from us, or do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after submitting your cancellation, please contact us immediately via phone. We require that cancellations of service are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing you are prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process reduces the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and ensures you are aware that the files, emails, and account may be removed immediately after a cancellation request is processed.</p><p>As a client of Mod Technologies, it is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time.

Mod Technologies gives you an unconditional 30 day money back guarantee on managed shared hosting, dedicated server, and reseller solutions for any customer who paid the first invoice with a credit card or with Paypal.</p><p>The following methods of payments are non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as credit to the hosting account:</p><p>* Bank Wire Transfers</p><p>* Western Union Payments</p><p>* Cash</p><p>* Checks</p><p>* Money orders</p><p>There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases. Refund requests for shared and reseller accounts after the initial 30 days will be refunded on a prorated basis of any unused time.</p><p>Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you\\u2019ve had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with us.</p><p>Violations of the Terms of Service or User Agreement will waive the refund policy.</p><p>7a.) Resource Usage</p><p>User may not:</p><p>a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.</p><p>b) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.</p><p>c) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.</p><p>d) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.</p><p>e) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.</p><p>f) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities</p><p>g) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc</p><p>h) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes</p><p>When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of include(\\u201chttp://yourdomain.com/include.php\\u201d) use include(\\u201cinclude.php\\u201d)</p><p>7b.) INODES</p><p>The use of more than 50,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in suspension. Accounts found to be exceeding the 50,000 inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup system to avoid overusage. Every file (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.</p><p>Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that constantly create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension.</p><p>The primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox. Over time, tens of thousands of messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit. To disable your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose \\u201cMail\\u201d, then \\u201cDefault Address\\u201d, \\u201cSet Default Address\\u201d, and then type in: :fail: No such user here</p><p>8.) Bandwidth Usage</p><p>You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.</p><p>9a.) Money back Guarantee</p><p>On dedicated servers and colocation no full refund will be honored \\u2014 the 30 day money back guarantee does not apply. We reserve the right to refund a prorated amount or no refund at all.</p><p>Each of Mod Technologies\\u2019s managed shared and reseller servers carry a 30 day unconditional money back guarantee on them. If you are not completely satisfied with our services within the first 30 days of your service, you will be given a full refund of the contract amount. Remember, this is only for monthly shared or reseller packages and does not apply to dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases.</p><p>9b.) Uptime Guarantee</p><p>If your shared / reseller server has a physical downtime that is not within the 99.9% uptime you may receive one month of credit on your account. Approval of the credit is at the discretion of Mod Technologies dependant upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor\\u2019s network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please contact sales@asdesignsandservices.com with justification. All requests must be made in writing via email. Uptime guarantees only apply to shared / reseller solutions. Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.</p><p>10.) Reseller: Client Responsibility</p><p>Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. Mod Technologies does not provide support to our Reseller\\u2019s Clients. If a reseller\\u2019s client contacts us, we reserve the right to place the client account on hold until the reseller can assume their responsibility for their client. All support requests must be made by the reseller on their clients\\u2019 behalf for security purposes. Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account and the actions of their clients\\u2019. Mod Technologies will hold any reseller responsible for any of their clients actions that violate the law or the terms of service.</p><p>11.) Shared (non-reseller accounts) / Semidedicated Servers</p><p>Shared accounts may not resell web hosting to other people, if you wish to resell hosting you must use a reseller account. Semidedicated servers are not backed up. You must maintain your own backups.</p><p>12.) Dedicated Servers</p><p>Mod Technologies reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for their dedicated server on file to prevent downtime from forced password resets. Mod Technologies reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us and it is the responsibility of the client to maintain backups or have a solution for this. You may purchase an additional hard drive and maintain backups to it as the most simple solution. Please contact sales@asdesignsandservices.com if you wish to obtain a secondary hard drive. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.</p><p>13.) Price Change</p><p>The amount you pay for hosting will never increase from the date of purchase. We reserve the right to change prices listed on our company websites, and the right to increase the amount of resources given to plans at any time.</p><p>14a.) Indemnification</p><p>Customer agrees that it shall defend, indemnify, save and hold Mod Technologies harmless from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims, including reasonable attorney\\u2019s fees asserted against Mod Technologies, its agents, its customers, officers and employees, that may arise or result from any service provided or performed or agreed to be performed or any product sold by customer, its agents, employees or assigns. Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mod Technologies against liabilities arising out of; (1) any injury to person or property caused by any products sold or otherwise distributed in connection with Mod Technologies; (2) any material supplied by customer infringing or allegedly infringing on the proprietary rights of a third party; (3) copyright infringement and (4) any defective products sold to customers from Mod Technologies\\u2019s server.</p><p>14b.) Arbitration</p><p>By using any Mod Technologies services, you agree to submit to binding arbitration. If any disputes or claims arise against Mod Technologies or its subsidiaries, such disputes will be handled by an arbitrator of Mod Technologies\\u2019s choice. An arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association or the National Arbitration Forum will be selected in the state of Michigan. Arbitrators shall be attorneys or retired judges and shall be selected pursuant to the applicable rules. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The arbitrator\\u2019s award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. You are also responsible for any and all costs related to such arbitration.</p><p>15.) Disclaimer</p><p>Mod Technologies shall not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. Mod Technologies makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for services we provide. Mod Technologies disclaims any warranty or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. This includes loss of data resulting from delays, no deliveries, wrong delivery, and any and all service interruptions caused by Mod Technologies and its employees.</p><p>16.)

We require that cancellations of service are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing you are prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the request.

Mod Technologies gives you an unconditional 30 day money back guarantee on managed shared hosting, dedicated server, and reseller solutions for any customer who paid the first invoice with a credit card or with Paypal.</p><p>The following methods of payments are non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as credit to the hosting account:</p><p>* Bank Wire Transfers</p><p>* Western Union Payments</p><p>* Cash</p><p>* Checks</p><p>* Money orders</p><p>There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases. Refund requests for shared and reseller accounts after the initial 30 days will be refunded on a prorated basis of any unused time.</p><p>Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you\u2019ve had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with us.</p><p>Violations of the Terms of Service or User Agreement will waive the refund policy.</p><p>7a.) Resource Usage</p><p>User may not:</p><p>a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.</p><p>b) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.</p><p>c) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.</p><p>d) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.</p><p>e) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.</p><p>f) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities</p><p>g) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc</p><p>h) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes</p><p>When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of include(\u201chttp://yourdomain.com/include.php\u201d) use include(\u201cinclude.php\u201d)</p><p>7b.) INODES</p><p>The use of more than 50,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in suspension. Accounts found to be exceeding the 50,000 inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup system to avoid overusage. Every file (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.</p><p>Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that constantly create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension.</p><p>The primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox. Over time, tens of thousands of messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit. To disable your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose \u201cMail\u201d, then \u201cDefault Address\u201d, \u201cSet Default Address\u201d, and then type in: :fail: No such user here</p><p>8.) Bandwidth Usage</p><p>You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.</p><p>9a.) Money back Guarantee</p><p>On dedicated servers and colocation no full refund will be honored \u2014 the 30 day money back guarantee does not apply. We reserve the right to refund a prorated amount or no refund at all.</p><p>Each of Mod Technologies\u2019s managed shared and reseller servers carry a 30 day unconditional money back guarantee on them. If you are not completely satisfied with our services within the first 30 days of your service, you will be given a full refund of the contract amount. Remember, this is only for monthly shared or reseller packages and does not apply to dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases.</p><p>9b.) Uptime Guarantee</p><p>If your shared / reseller server has a physical downtime that is not within the 99.9% uptime you may receive one month of credit on your account. Approval of the credit is at the discretion of Mod Technologies dependant upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor\u2019s network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please contact sales@asdesignsandservices.com with justification. All requests must be made in writing via email. Uptime guarantees only apply to shared / reseller solutions. Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.</p><p>10.) Reseller: Client Responsibility</p><p>Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. Mod Technologies does not provide support to our Reseller\u2019s Clients. If a reseller\u2019s client contacts us, we reserve the right to place the client account on hold until the reseller can assume their responsibility for their client. All support requests must be made by the reseller on their clients\u2019 behalf for security purposes. Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account and the actions of their clients\u2019. Mod Technologies will hold any reseller responsible for any of their clients actions that violate the law or the terms of service.</p><p>11.) Shared (non-reseller accounts) / Semidedicated Servers</p><p>Shared accounts may not resell web hosting to other people, if you wish to resell hosting you must use a reseller account. Semidedicated servers are not backed up. You must maintain your own backups.</p><p>12.) Dedicated Servers</p><p>Mod Technologies reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for their dedicated server on file to prevent downtime from forced password resets. Mod Technologies reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us and it is the responsibility of the client to maintain backups or have a solution for this. You may purchase an additional hard drive and maintain backups to it as the most simple solution. Please contact sales@asdesignsandservices.com if you wish to obtain a secondary hard drive. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.</p><p>13.) Price Change</p><p>The amount you pay for hosting will never increase from the date of purchase. We reserve the right to change prices listed on our company websites, and the right to increase the amount of resources given to plans at any time.</p><p>14a.)

Arbitration</p><p>By using any Mod Technologies services, you agree to submit to binding arbitration. If any disputes or claims arise against Mod Technologies or its subsidiaries, such disputes will be handled by an arbitrator of Mod Technologies\u2019s choice. An arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association or the National Arbitration Forum will be selected in the state of Michigan. Arbitrators shall be attorneys or retired judges and shall be selected pursuant to the applicable rules. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The arbitrator\u2019s award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. You are also responsible for any and all costs related to such arbitration.</p><p>15.) Disclaimer</p><p>Mod Technologies shall not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. Mod Technologies makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for services we provide. Mod Technologies disclaims any warranty or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
