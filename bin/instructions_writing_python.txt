When writing a queryset, the variable should have '_qs' at the end, to show that it is a queryset object.

for example:

    offer_qs = portal_models.Offer.objects.filter(author=user)
    context = {
            'offer_list': offer_qs,
        }



Two spaces between Functions and classes


Class based views should be placed in order:
Detailview, Listview, CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView, two spaces apart.
