When you’re designing using a constrained set of values, decision-making is
a lot easier because there are a lot fewer “right” choices.
For example, say you’re trying to choose a size for an icon. You’ve defined a
sizing scale in advance where your only small-to-medium sized options are
12px, 16px, 24px, and 32px.
